		<h2>Championship Titles</h2>
		<p>Since the LA Clippers birth (1971), the Clippers have won no championships. Which is
		humiliating because they've been in this league for 47 years and haven't won or ogtten out of the
		second rounce once. I mean cmon, who would want to go for a team like that, just humiliaing to the NBA
		and Los Angeles.

		<h2>Playoff Appearances/Hall Of Famers</h2>
			<p>The Clippers have had no, and i mean no Hall Of Famers these past decades.
			I mean sheesh, 47 years in the league and no Hall Of Famers......wow. Lets nont forget that
			they had CP3 but oops, he was traded. Cmon, you actually think the Clippers are a good franchise?
			Literally no championships, and no H.O.F's and really not a good team till present day (The next page).
